                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">    This is an abstract piece of art I performed on the UC Davis campus, wherein I printed out around 500 copies of the image above.  I then walked around the campus with the pages in a stack and would drop them randomly on the ground.  When someone would come up to me to inform me that I had dropped it, I would say things such as, “Ahh, don’t worry about it, I have a bunch more.” or “Just leave it there, I’m sure someone will pick it up.” People that did not see me drop it would simple walk over it and completely ignore it, even if there was ten or so visible pages within the vicinity.  The way the information was presented was in a sort of anti-design matter (with the filename and page number printed), and thus triggered responses from people that they did not need the information, without so much as glancing at what was presented.  It also demonstrated people’s permeability to new ideas and beliefs, as older people were generally more sure that they did not need the sheet, while younger students were more accepting.  This could be due to a perceived difference in social classes, and older people would be less inclined to perceive me as one of their group.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1">    This is a criticism to the general passivity that people have when going through life. Rather than evaluate every decision made on a case by case basis, people will simply ignore things that don’t seem pertinent to their immediate objectives. Also, if no one else is paying attention to some information or behaving in some alarmist manner, the idea of it is often discredited, discarded, disregarded or forgotten. It is important for people to absorb and work through many different ideas and pieces of information rather than continue old schools of thought. Without personal evaluation of behavior and information, our path will fall into the hands of someone else, and even if that someone else is nobody we will fall victim to the dynamics of inherent group stupidity, wherein no one makes waves, although everyone acknowledges the direction is less than ideal. This leads humanity to continue to move as sheep instead of actively creating new directions. Business as usual continues, while the erosion of the foundations of equity, freedom, or sustainability continue.</p>
