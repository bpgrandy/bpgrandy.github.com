                  <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1">The argument between fundamentalist Christians and modern science is common and heated. Radioactive dating of rocks has proved the universe was created in much more than 7 days, leading the Christians to backtrack and say &quot;Well, back then each day could have been much longer.&quot; Darwinian evolution has disproved fundamentalist Christian creationism and has lead them to backtrack to intelligent design, which is just another mask for creationism. The question behind everyone's mind is &quot;How could an organism as complicated and complex as a human being be created out of nothing, with nothing more than random chance and survival of the fittest?&quot;<br /><br />Well, there are many things to consider. The big bang happened 17.8 billion years ago. There is a theory that exists that evolution started at this time, before the planet even came into existence. But, if it started when our planet was created, then it has had 4.5 billion years to work. The evolutionary history of primates can be traced back to 85 million years. It took 85 million years just to evolve the primate from its original form to the modern day human. In contrast, the kind of societal, technological, and cultural evolution that has occurred within the last 500 years has been astounding. The lifespan of the Neanderthal was only 20 years, and by the time of classical Greece and Rome, the life expectancy was still only 20-30 years. Within the last century, the life expectancy has doubled. The world average is now around 67, and US is in the upper range at around 78. Is evolution suddenly playing a role that it never has, and to an extreme degree that for some reason kicked in within the last century? No, it’s a result of true intelligent design.<br /><br />Modern medical science is actual very counter-intuitive to what natural selection wants. Medical science finds cures for the most deadly diseases, gives birth to those that would otherwise die, creates artificial organs etc. All of this, so that the most weak can survive and reproduce. The mutated and defective can continue to pass on their genes, and in a sense, reverse evolution. No one would argue that the fundamental aspects that comprise human parts has altered within the last hundred years, yet people today seem to be so much more advance than those of last century. People live twice as long, are more educated, have easier access to knowledge and communication, are more cultured, exist much more efficiently, and in general, are more intelligent.<br /><br />What's the reason for all this cultural and technological development? The human intelligence. The driving principle behind our cultural evolution within the last hundred years has been intelligence, reason, and rational thought. These are the principles that have advanced technology, culture, and science. In contrast to Darwinian evolution, intelligent thought has a much more directed approach. Evolution is a brute force approach of evolving humans, whereas rational thought only moves in the direction of reason. 30,000 years of evolutionary development from Neanderthals to ancient Romans did virtually nothing in terms of the average lifespan of humans, whereas within 100 years, intelligent thought has doubled it.<br /><br />I think a big problem is that people tend to be very cocky about the human race. We think we're so great, we're so amazing, designed perfectly, and without flaw. The human body IS the most complex intelligence that exists on the planet, but that does not mean it was designed entirely intelligently. One puncture to a number of different large arteries will end your life. Our beloved eyesight can only detect a very narrow range of the light spectrum, and many other animals have better. Our sense of smell is nothing in comparison with certain dogs that can detect the difference of two molecules that differ only by a carbon atom. Our sense of hearing is nothing in relationship to bats. We have no ability to produce silk like spiders, we can not camouflage with the environment like many creatures, we can not release chemicals into the air the send signals, we can not regenerate limbs like many animals, and we are so physically weak that we cannot even defend ourselves one on one against many creatures like bears. When you actually consider all the forces, waves, and actions of the universe, our five senses only detect a very narrow range of it. Intelligent thought is our niche in evolution, and it happened somewhat illogically. Logically, the biggest creatures should dominate the world. We are very close in the modern world, but if dinosaurs had never died off through whatever means, it is perhaps unlikely that intelligent thought would have ever had a chance to develop to overcome all the other advantages of the other spices.<br /><br />Also, consider what our purpose as creatures of a long line of evolution is: to reproduce. Those who reproduce, get passed on, those who don't, die off. What is society really obsessed with in modern culture? Sex and relationships. People spend their entire lives trying to buy new clothes, work out at the gym, sleep with as many girls as possible, gain money or power [status symbols to attract the other sex], and that's just the reproductive part of the brain firing. There is evidence to suggest that even our conception of beauty is primarily based on evolutionary forces, and has a commonality. We find landscapes with open nature ranges and a source of water with a path to be pleasing. It is simply the environment that our species has the greatest survival chance. We find many fine works of jewelry, art, craft, or any high leveled skill to be beauty. It is simply a fitness signal that whomever created the work has the competence for fine motor skills and a decent intelligence.<br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1"><br />Another fundamental part of the brain is involving in keeping your own nourishment so you can survive until you reproduce, and that's why food is such a huge topic. Where are we going to eat? When are we going to eat? What do I enjoy eating because evolution has made me enjoy foods with higher fat content more? What can you eat so the opposite sex still wants to reproduce with you? And then there is alcohol and drugs. This is just modern human exploiting the basic principles of our brain by creating chemicals that play with it. Most of these substances cause an increase in dopamine, which is one of the most fundamental reward chemicals. No wonder that if we were programmed to do what delivers the most dopamine, we would exploit it once we figure out how to go straight to the source.<br /><br />Recent developments in nano-technology have created theoretical better red blood cells in the form of tiny machines. If you replaced just 1/5 of your current blood cells with the improved model, you could sit at the bottom of a swimming pool for 4 hours and run at Olympic speeds. Developments like this really prove how much room for improvement exists in our brute force evolutionary design with the help of true intelligent design.<br /><br />So, what's the point of all this? Despite everything, humans are still pretty basic creatures. We act on our wants and wills, which we are convinced it's because of true love, when in reality, it's because she would make ideal offspring. I'm not saying it’s impossible to love someone for reasons beyond the superficial, just that many attractive forces rely entirely on primitive instincts. The solution? THINK. Stop obsessing your life over principles which evolution is controlling. Once you realize how much you are manipulated by your primal instincts, it's easier to live with and accept them.</p>
