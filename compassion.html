                  <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1">The most basic of human instincts is involved when coming across a new person, and it is said that upwards of 70% of your impression of another human is made within the first couple minutes of coming into contact with them. There is an evolutionary answer to why this is the case. Our emotional, primitive, reptilian brain the amygdala functions as the gatekeeper for our decisions. Often decisions are made with the Amygdala and the Neocortex will simply serve to create a rationalization for why that choice was made.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Scientists have theorized that a reason that the emotional brain serves a role in our decision making is emotions have a way of short circuiting the otherwise lengthy process of evaluating a situation. If you're sitting around scratching your head and considering all the possible ways you might avoid a given situation the tiger will be gnawing on your neocortex before you decide that maybe the best idea might be to run. Thus, the valuable decision that the Amygdala makes is it gives you the answer of friend or foe, fight or flight in a split second.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Unfortunately, this outdated circuitry still guides our day-to-day behavior despite having life-threatening situations all but eliminated from our lives. Today, for the first time in history in the developed world, we have the luxury do sit around and consider our actions, reflect on our decisions, and with the world of information at our fingertips to really consider and research every possible choice. No longer do we need to spend the majority of our lives in search of survival related activities. Modern agriculture has allowed the developed world to have an abundance of food, a population that is sheltered, medicine and fitness to keep you healthy, and generally created an abundance of free time, which most people spend pursuing some career or enjoying entertainment.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Still, when at a party or some social gathering we instinctively know the people we find appealing and the people we do not. The Amygdala has no capacity for language so we will say such things as they were rude, stupid, prissy, haughty, uninteresting, talked too little, did not talk enough, negative, immature, shallow, unhygienic, inappropriate, creepy, boring, depressing, phony, mean-spirited, evil, offensive, brutish, annoying, ugly, inferior, and so on and on this basis will claim them a foe and wish to have nothing to do with them. And vice versa in contraposition, the opposite adjectives are applied and we will deem them a friend. This is the way the majority of people operate when deciding which people with which one should spend their time.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1">Mother Teresa said it most succinctly, &quot;When you criticize people you have no time to love them.&quot; If instead of judging someone else by a checklist of qualities, simply approach every human being with the objective to achieve some sort of connection, develop the relationship, to disagree without being disagreeable, to find some common ground and connect with, to be amused together, to reflect together, or simply to love them unconditionally. Compassion, sympathy, and empathy offer a toolbox to try to help our fellow sojourners, rather than just simply criticizing them and choosing not to interact with them further. If you do see qualities that you find reprehensible it is negligent to simply leave that person existing in a manner that you disagree with. By trying to understand their situation and help them to see the world differently, you can creative a positive ripple effect that will, with time, change the world. If you simply declare them your foe and try to use negative energy to cancel their negative energy, you will exercise in futility. However, positive energy used appropriately can inspire and change their choices to create a world that is in line with your values. Remember, you will not persuade someone that you have convinced to be your enemy.</p>
