Orphaned away at birth and taken into a strange land you were stranded from anything you might have ever known, and plunked into a hermetically chlorinated partially toxic water. What had you done to deserve this? What part might you have had in your fate? You were never given any rights, any freedom, nor a single hand in your destiny. No, you were whipped away into a new environment, stranded from any and all life you once knew.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"> <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">    A simple tank with a pebble floor and a panorama view. A view of a life you could never touch.  At first Blackberry, the Beta in you stood tall, taking ownership of the space and the openness: it was all yours. You told yourself “This is a zen-like sanctuary”. “Most animals only fantasize about this kind of view.” But slowly, the novelty of the environment soon gave way to the perpetual tedium of the same day in day out one gallon environment. The lack of cover, the lack of shelter, always exposed violated every instinctual urge in your fish guts, and the windows began to feel more like prison walls. No, it wasn’t you that was looking out, but everyone that was looking in. You were simply a passing amusement for owners’ that had much bigger things to worry about than your daily bread.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">    Day after day, trapped inside those hexagonal plexiglass walls, without even any knowledge if today would be a day to eat. Just waiting, looking, trying to survive, and in the only way to express your outrage lashing out to bite the hand that feeds, a misguided communication that was interpreted as a sign of affection. &quot;Ahhhh, he's trying to kiss me!&quot; Perhaps this fate is worse than death itself, it is death by a thousand cuts, everyday spent contemplating where destiny might lead, if you were ever be free from this prison, if you might ever see another one of your kind, or even if some god would have the mercy to let you consume a piece of their cast off crumbs. <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"> <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">    The same repetitive swim inside those same hexagonal clear plastic walls. The highlights of your life only the eventual occasion of a single plant; the day the bubbler came; and a change of food pellets to flakes. In your mind it was all the daily gruel. After the plant arrived, your connection to reality began to lose its hold. The algae crept up the walls of what was once an untouched vista. First, you only lost an inch at bottom or a piece of the top, places you weren't especially interested in looking at anyway... but day after day, it continued its steady march. The only entertainment you knew, the only company you ever had, was being eaten away by the algae virus. Eventually, you were left with just a sliver of reality. A tiny peephole that you could understand the world beyond your cage. But upon wakening, realized you had finally slipped into the world of the all encompassing and hopeless emerald prison.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">    Even after you lost any and all contact with the outside world, you still held out. Convinced that you had gone blind, you continued forward, left with little option other than waiting for the next flakes. A meager meal that came sporadically and was just enough to support your existence. Then one day the flakes stopped coming. Another day of madness, trying to survive, swimming in circles, would today be the day? No. Your body began to eat itself, your muscles atrophied, and you awaited the eventual demise of your last breath. But then, just as you had lost all hope, you awoke from a fantasy of freedom to the low humming of the bubbler: evidence that the gods at taken notice of your existence! And, from the heavens came raining down a glorious feast, flake after flake, you kept eating until you felt that you were to burst, but the gods continued to provide, and you continued to indulge. Eventually, your entire body had been stuffed and could not force down another bite. Convinced that this was the pinnacle of your existence, and the greatest pleasure you would ever know, you swam to the bottom of the tank to take your eternal sleep.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"> <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">…<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"> <br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1">    What future awaited for you had you the ability to hold out longer? Perhaps you would be moved to a new scenery, or maybe even released into the great Spreckles Lake for a chance to sink or swim. Would you be free then? After your prison had expanded? A new reality sure, but still trapped within a finite environment. No, you recognized that we're all trapped inside the prison of our own reality, a prison that it seems we can escape and be free when we are young, but slowly that curtain falls and our optimism wanes. Each day we lose a bit of freedom until we live a life entirely of habit, entirely out of circumstance and obligation. Even though we have the illusion of choice, it is just that. Betas are fighters to the very end, but can still draw the line between hope and delusion.</p>
