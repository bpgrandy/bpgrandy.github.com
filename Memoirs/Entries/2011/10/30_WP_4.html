                  <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="Body">Destination: hawaii. incorporated in 1962 this once mystical island that valued things contrary to the american capitalist structure: relaxation, moving slowly, appreciating nature, and enjoying the simpler ways of life has since completely lost its direction. The island (Maui) which is small enough that you would never need an automobile is peppered with them, and like every good state in the USA has become the definitive mode of transportation, despite the fact that it takes roughly 30 mins to reach one side of the island to the other.  <br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">We arrive and we immediately get a rental car, which there are 5 or 6 different companies competing for your business. Youre handed brochures which espouse all the various tours and cruises on which you can save 20%.<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">I read up on the history of hawaii and learned they have lost the most endemic specie of any state, and were obviously once a very independent ecosystem.<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">There is this strange sort of juxtaposition that goes on in Maui, where if you put horse blinders on and blocked out anything outside the street, you could be in any other state in the country. But then, just outside the beautiful paved roads is a sort of third world state of development, and the ridiculous mountain scape in the background. Driving through hawaii, strip malls adourned with blockbuster, radioshack, safeway and yes even an L &amp; L hawaiian BBQ outlet, which make you wonder are you really in hawaii or is this simply a sort of disneyland version of itself. Then theres costco. What once was the bustling center of commerce and marketplace in maui has become the one stop shop for the locals and tourists alike.<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">The parking lot was so full it was several hundred cars, it was clear that about half of the current occupants in maui were in costco.<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">If you are placed inside this costco you have no idea that youre in hawaii, you could be in any state in the USA, but what distinguishes it is in the choice of products. Not only can you buy the standard $4,000 massage chair, foosball table, or 70” flat screen TV, local hawaiian items are sprinkled throughout the store. What was once, I am sure, an independent marketplace where hawaii goods were presented in a unique fashion has turned into the only reality that hawaii must face if it wishes to remain viable as a functioning state in the US economy. Hand made, custom cultural hawaiian icons are stacks up tall in piles immediately adjacently to peanuts in 5 lb minimum quantities or Qc10, the latest in proven body enhancement drink. My parents were constantly trying to find the cheapest price and using nothing other than that as a metric for determining quality. This is the logical eventuality of capitalism. On one hand people are driven to commoditize everything and are disconnected from the romance of the marketplace and  and places lose a sense of uniqueness. On the other hand, it is the most efficient system so more people have access to more, cheaper, which theoretically should bring more joy, health, and happiness.<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">Is this the inevitability that every capitalist based society faces? Sure, the US is a figure head because it is among the most developed of countries and has parading the free market the strongest, but surely if this is what the market does are not all economies eventually headed in this direction?<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">We ended up buying much more than we needed in costco, and then headed to safeway for a similar experience. San Francisco’s efforts to keep big box stores out have resulted in an experience, I have now realized, that is more exotic than Hawaii.<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">We found a “craft fair”, which was basically a group of different locals all selling the same souvenir crap. when i pressured the man with the souvenir stand admitted that he buys from a corporate dealership and I realized that everything he made is essentially built in china.<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">Souvenirs designed so that people can take them back to their homes and relay the message that they were lucky enough to enjoy this “exotic” vacation to hawaii. To cover themselves in what has become the mass-marketed image of what hawaii style is: Kona shells, bracelets, ukeleles, hibiscus flowers.<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">purchasing milk at safeway I make a comment that the milk is $5/ gallon, implying that its cost is related to the carbon involved to get the milk fresh, and it is obviously not local. My Dad replies oh “Nov 10, Nov 5, well get the November 10, it’s almost a week fresher!” completely ignoring my comment on the expense of it. Later we realize that the milk has a pinhole leak in it, not enough to be dripping, but the side is slightly moist. I say, “Do you want to switch it out? you know they’ll have to throw it out...” My mother replies, “Yeah, I don’t want that, it’s dripping”<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">When checking out at both costco and safeway I noticed native hawaii’s forced into the capitalist role of grocery store checker. They did not seem joyful in the role, just the general attitutude of complacency that so many passive of the american “workforce” have adopted. They had become part of the system just as the native americans could not resist the american capitalist force.<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">When bringing out the bags of groceries that we had purchased from safeway because the quantities were too great at costco, which were also excessive, the corona handle broke smashed into the parking lot. Who is to place the liability on the broken handles?<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">is it me for trying to think I could carry more than I could?<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">is it the poorly tried native hawaiian for not knowing in independently bottle 6-packs?<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">is it corona for designed such a poor case so that the handle broke under simply its own weight?<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">is it the american mindset of wanting to constantly booze up and have accessible forms of liquor?<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">we come into the condo, which was rented by a family friend, im amazed at how beautiful the cabinet work is, how nice the furniture, the spacious balcony. My mother’s response “It’s small, but it’ll do.”<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p class="Body">there is something artificial around spaces that are “designed” for tourists that I can’t quite escape. the grass outside our timeshare is meticulously mowed, and everything seems to be so planned out its sickening.<br /></p>
                  <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="Body">“ok, beer time.” my mother states, exhausted after all the shopping “I think I’m going to have to go get another six”</p>
