    <richText>Maybe it&#x2019;s because I just saw Source Code, where the entire movie is set on the train, but I feel as if the $6.75 hour and 10 minute experience includes entertainment that is my fellow travelers. I&#x2019;m sitting in silence in the middle of the chaos. People are reading, drinking, watching movies, on facebook, and mostly on their iPhones. I feel this gives a new perspective on people as I&#x2019;m able to listen to a conversation between two strangers. That interaction is not something I would ever be able to experience through a group or one-on-one interaction because my presence fundamentally flavors the dynamic of the interaction. These are people at their truest, this is humanity. Laughing, stressing, talking, reflecting, racist, curious, bored &amp; smiling. People dreaming of traveling. This is my first entry, I&#x2019;ve never been much of a writer, especially in the pen &amp; paper form but what I&#x2019;m realizing this format has to offer is a way for my thoughts to flow but be structured in a coherent form. It&#x2019;s like having a patient listener and never having to worry if you&#x2019;re talking too much. This much be why introverts like reading, because they are such good listeners they can sit for hours just listening. This notebook is essentially infinite for all intents &amp; purposes. I&#x2019;m excited to not have to filter my thoughts, just stream of consciousness and editing can come later. Also, what this format offers is that it looks as if I&#x2019;m busy, staying occupied, but really I&#x2019;m just intensely focused on those around me., without them feeling self-conscious. It also allows me to move between people, experiencing the cornocopia of interactions, a luxury that few enjoy. I promise I didn&#x2019;t plan for my memoirs to start on page 69. Flipped open to a random page, started writing while numbering. When you think about it, a memoir is a written document of that age old question, &#x201C;How was your day?&#x201D; If my day is really worth reflecting upon, I will try to make an attempt to record it. Couple just got off the train, gay guy + female friend. Highlight of conversation &#x201C;Someone in my class asked the prof. why he decided to do teaching instead of being an entrepeneur. Prof. replied he likes teaching and didn&#x2019;t need the money. It&#x2019;s nice to know that my teachers are in it for the right thing.&#x201D; says the gay man. There&#x2019;s an accepted implication and point of agreement between him &amp; the prof. that entrepeneurs solely care about money. That&#x2019;s too bad, looks like people don&#x2019;t have the romanticized ideal of an entrepeneur that I do. I don&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;s just me but at times I feel the need to break rules even if they&#x2019;re rules I created. This can be about my plans later, my own personal ideals of behavior, or just what to do next. I suppose it comes from my yearning to explore and feeling as if I agree to certain values and life choices that my existence essentially becomes determined etc. That&#x2019;s why I smoked cigarettes, treated my girlfriend with a strange affect, and decided to get on a train to see her despite telling Alexander of La Rouche that I would discuss Nuclear Energy tonight. Maybe it&#x2019;s that or maybe it&#x2019;s just the thought of incredible sex. Whatever the case, I need a break from Pi for a couple days. &#x201C;Next stop Santa Clara&#x201D;&#xD;(RIP Steve Jobs)&#xD;</richText>
