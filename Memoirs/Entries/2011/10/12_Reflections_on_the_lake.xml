    <richText>New Entry: This is one of those ones that serves to get the lubrication flowing in the cerebellum. Also, to reflect on my actions from a higher level and ponder some of the things I should be pondering. Why do I go on reddit for hours? I am looking, I am searching for truth. When you don&#x2019;t find truth, you need a new strategy, a new approach, how new? hard to say. a different sub-reddit maybe, a different website could be, a different form of media consumption maybe, or simply an active vs. passive switch. This is the problem I have, and I assume I&#x2019;m not the only one. Reading endless amounts of news, stories, and whatever the hell other people are talking about almost makes me feel like I&#x2019;m moving towards having an authority on some subject. The only problem is, it&#x2019;s truly endless. You will spend so much time browsing, you will never have any form of creation to show for it. This is the demise of modern era. One must be really selective and self-conscious with one&#x2019;s actions, time is the most precious thing we have. It&#x2019;s easy to forget that when it seems so abundant, so endless on a daily basis. Smoking weed prevents me from being able to look at my actions from a level of higher order. It traps me in those low levels of behavior, and I accept that. Perhaps me simply accepting that is a surrender to that condition. Surely, that condition can be fought against but not without a good deal of struggle. Surrendering to that alternate reality I admit is a low-character move, and yet I continuing try to justify it. Why is it that I need to escape to some alternate reality? It must be there is something lacking with the true reality. Why did I really want to smoke? All these drugs are distractions, and I post-rationalize one with another.&#xD;&#xD;Creating seems to give meaning to the banal. Whether it&#x2019;s designing, drawing, writing, coding, or whatever it seems to legitimize my existence. It&#x2019;s creating a legacy, even if that legacy is nothing more than what&#x2019;s been said. Even if that legacy drowns in the sea of voices, there are plenty of other&#x2019;s that have creating things without so much the intention of originality. If I open anyone&#x2019;s mind in some way or give someone even the slightest of a differentiation in perspective, I think my life to be well lived. Must we constantly alternate between these realities of feelings of ground-breaking and routine? Is there a way to maintain the high creation of something beautiful brings? It is rather self-serving, this yearning to leave a legacy. I am more interested in creating something for myself than I am trying to get meaning from others. Oh well, whatever maintains your sanity, right? and this certainly does. I don&#x2019;t think I could ever talk to a friend this openly, and have them judge me as I judge myself, working through my thoughts. In a conversation it is typically expected that you have established yourself on one side or another, a constant dialogue with yourself is not encouraged. How unfortunate.</richText>
