                  <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1">There are many reasons why I am no longer attending the esteemed university system.  One is curiosity.  There exist, in california, several competing and completely independent educational institutions, the community college, the state schools, and the UC system.  They are not designed holistically, and thus offer completely independent approaches to learning.  One must choose which institution to attend based on hearsay, 3rd party rating systems, and the facade that the school creates. Then, once an institution is chosen, the student is on that path, and given a subjective experience of one system, without really ever being able to experience the other substitute goods.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Dropping out of the UC system and pursuing other forms of education allows me to preserve my remaining education money, and spend it much more efficiently than I ever could have in the UC system.  One year of UC education (room and board), can amount to almost a complete college experience cost, especially with the recent 30% tuition hike.  Why is it that the UC system and other prestigious universities are so expensive?  There is a massive amount of overhead and administrative costs that rarely contribute to a more learned individual, albeit a complaisant and happy one.  After all, UC Davis boasts an 88% overall approval rating, one of the highest of schools out there. The best way to keep a population calm, satisfied, and unprotesting, is to create a such a great show that one does not feel that things should be any different.  Creating great buildings, top of the line facilities, a great community, and a happy environment, people will never feel as if anything is wrong.  This is something UC Davis does very well, and the town of Davis is a great place to live and one of the few places I would choose to live.  All the pleasantness allows actual teaching skills to fall by the wayside, and forces students to continue through with the system they have embarked on.  Pressured by their parents to continue with the education that was so hard earned, and feeling relaxed in the community, the student is found almost trapped in pleasantness.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">When given a tour of UC Davis, they boast that the average student changes their major something like 3 times, THREE TIMES.  They say this as if it's a fact to be celebrated, but it's one of the few indicators of uninspiring teachers and classes, or maybe simply an indicator of a lost generation.  It's not really UCD's fault that they do not produce the best teachers as faculty, that is not the main goal of the institution.  Instead you have researchers who are begrudgingly forced to teach undergrads when they never intended to be teachers, and have little training.  Dealing with undergrads is seen as punishment by most of the faculty, and I do not blame them when the majority of the student body sees school as punishment and work, to be avoided at all but the most threatening costs.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Only a few of them, maybe 10%, were like me: endless inquisitive, fascinated by learning, staying after class to get my question answered, not because it would be on the test, but because I was genuinely curious.  When I asked questions in class I would constantly get scowls from my classmates as they knew that I was not asking a question that would be explicitly on the test, and some of them even approached me asking me to stop wasting their time, when it was at most 5 minutes additional material the teacher might have to flesh out, material, I thought, served often served to get many students to stop browsing Facebook, texting, and just spacing out paying attention again, and not simply suffering the endless monotonous drone of the prof. until they had permission to leave.  Approximately 20% of the class were the smart alecs.  They would always do the reading the night before, sit at the front of the class, brownnose the prof. at any opportunity, and raise their hands not because they were curious about the information being presented, but rather to assert their egos in having immaculately captured a very tiny chunk of information in a specialized field.  The majority of the class, I'd say 70%, are trying to get through the school with as little effort as possible, get a passing grade in each class, and grab that all important piece of paper that tells society you're worth something.  They don't care about the learning, they just care about what's going to be on the test, and what's the minimal amount of work that they can do so they can have plenty of time to get to what they ACTUALLY want to do.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">I can't blame them.  The system is set-up to see learning as the enemy.  Learning is presented in a system under constant pressure of parents, peers, and teachers, and the idea of flunking a class is the ultimate sign that you're a loser.  It's the system that's been the driving motivation since kindergarden.  If you mess up in elementary, you won't get into a good middle school, if you mess up in middle school you won't get into a good high school, if you mess up in high school, you won't get into a good college, and if you mess up in college, you'll surely be a loser your whole life.  This is the lie that's fed to us, this is the lie that keeps people going to class.  It's not because they actually enjoying learning and discovering something new, it's the fear that everyone will be disappointed, their life will amount to nothing, and they are forever doomed.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Well, I chose one day to stop living in fear and to start doing what the institution I was attending was purported to provide, to spend every day learning as efficiently as possible.  Thus, when I went to class and the material was very basic, presented slowly, and with very little information density, I chose to stop going.  I was discovering material on my own that proved to be far more stimulating, and every time I went back to class it felt like I was walking in on a kindergarden classroom.  The information was dumbed down, simplified, packaged, presented slowly, and repeated thoroughly, so that even if you spaced out the whole time during class, did none of the readings (which many of my classmates proudly professed that they passed a class without ever cracking the textbook!), and gave a half concerted effort of the homework assignments, you still would not fail.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">I found out the limits to which failing was impossible starting in fall quarter 2009.  I took a G.I.S.(Geographic and Information Systems) course that I was very interested in, but could hardly sit through the lectures as he spent an hour presenting concepts that could be explained in five minutes.  Most of the lecture was just presenting the same idea with different words, and then getting sidetracked. So I stopped attending. Come the midterm, I studied half an hour before the test by browsing wikipedia on the keywords that had been included in the study guide. I got a B on the midterm. I was flabbergasted. I didn't attend the class until the final. I got a B in the class. I shouldn't have been allowed to do this. I knew very little about G.I.S. and if there was actually new information presented everyday there is no way I would have been able to get away with this. Instead, I suspected, teachers were encouraged to get students in and out, and create the facade of a system that actually measures one's progress while in reality simply sending everyone down the assembly line that is our education system.  The next quarter, along with the encouragement from &quot;Secrets of  Buccaneer Scholar&quot;, I attempted to fail classes.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"> <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">[EDIT 1:<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Then there's the story of this Intro to Plant Science course I took.  First of all, as part of the landscape architecture curriculum, you are required to take either Plant Science 2, Biology 2A (biology for science majors), or Biology 10 (survey course that is incredibly dumbed down).  Well, Biology 10 was the easiest of the options, so it was the one that was recommended by my advisors, and it was what most people in Landscape Architecture took.  Well, Landscape Architecture largely involves plants, so an intro to plant science course could provide a fundamental understanding of how plants work, how to care for them, how to maintain them, what their function is, etc.  Naturally, I signed up for this class, and I think was the only declared Landscape Architect to do so (to my knowledge).  It was one of the best classes and best teachers I have ever had.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">The professor talked very quickly, went through concepts at a pace where you have trouble both writing down everything he said and paying attention, and taught exactly how I enjoy to learn (very high information density).  I often opt to not take notes as I find I rarely look at them, or it will distract me from listening, or I write down some key words that I might forget or that the teacher especially emphasized.  Most people blindly copy anything written on the board, but this was a class where he went through slides so quickly that if you tried to simply copy all the text, you would have taken away zero comprehension.  The class was an hour every day of pure information absorption, the nuts and bolts of plant science.  I found the knowledge very useful and fascinating, and it made my future environmental horticulture class much easier.  He covered the evolution of plants, their individual parts, different biological cycles, different classes of plants, everything you could imagine.  It was a great class.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">We had to write a paper for the class and do some independent research, and we were to meet with our TA to discuss the paper topic which was of our choosing.  Most people wrote about very common subjects, stuff there was already a lot of literature about and topics that well covered and easy.  I was always fascinated about hydroponics and aquaponics and wanted to do a research paper about the economic feasibility of aquaponics versus traditional agriculture.  Oh, on a side note I asked the professor what classes I could take to learn more about aqua and hydroponics and he told me that UC Davis, a renowned agricultural research institution didn't offer any plant science courses in new forms of agricultural.  Apparently all the research went into ways to improve tradition agriculture which destroys the majority of our arable land, is incredibly resource intensive and inefficient, and is a not sustainable method for future growth.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Anyway, I went in finally to talk to my TA about my research project and find out that the midterm was the same day, in an about an hour.  I didn't have time to go home, I didn't have access to a computer, I had to make do with whatever resources were on hand.  So I walked into the building in which the class was held, hoping to find some students studying, and kind enough to let me scan over some key concepts.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">I was very fortunate and came across a girl that was the polar opposite of me.  I had seen this girl walking around and she would speed walk in an exact straight line, staring directly ahead unflinching, literally as if she had horse blinders on.  I tried to make eye contact once, and she didn't even look away, she saw the objective, what she needed to do to achieve it and nothing else.  This girl represented what a model student looks like in the current system of learning.  She did exactly as she was told, came to class every day, wrote down everything on the board, studied and stressed religiously, memorizing the facts that she was told to, spit them out when it was time, and nothing else.  I think she was even one of those people that interrupted the professor while explaining something not to get clarification of the concept, but simply to know if it would be on the test.  The test was the objective, the test was the goal, and nothing else mattered.  Anyway, I see this girl sitting outside the classroom before the midterm, religiously looking over previous tests that she had printed out from a friend, filled in the answers, flash cards, and study guides, and was trying to make sure every last concept could be crammed word for word, so it could be spit out verbatim in a few minutes.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">This method of superficial learning without any deeper understanding of underlying concepts is not only allowed to exist, but actually prospers quite effectively in the current system.  She generously allowed me to look over one of the previous tests, and I tried to grasp the some concepts in my last remaining minutes.  I remember asking her to explain one of the plant types that I didn't fully understand and her answer was literally &quot;There's only 4 of the 5 we need to know for the test, we don't need to know that one.&quot;  There was a concept that was listed in the textbook with equal importance to 4 other concepts, and she had no knowledge of it because she was told it wasn't required.  Students like this don't fully grasp concepts, they just memorize answers to certain queries, which develops a very vulnerable level of understanding, something one could program a robot to do.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Ideally, I see tests not as an opportunity to spit out the facts you have crammed in your short term memory, but as a time for learning.  If you go into a test knowing very little, or perhaps related concepts, you might have to reason through some latin roots of vocabulary with which you are not familiar, use process of elimination on answers you know are flat wrong, and try to connect the dots once you find something later in the test that proves your thought process earlier couldn't be correct.  The test is like a puzzle: very enjoyable, and very stimulating.  If instead you study in the traditional way, it is simply a measure of your memorization abilities.  This is what I did on the test, and I believe I did fairly well.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">The next day the professor goes over all the right answers on the test as well as the percentage of students that got it correct.  The questions I missed were the ones that around 80%+ of the class got correctly.  The questions I got right were the ones that only 10% of the class answered correctly.  Because I approached the test with a different set of rules, a different understanding, and not a programmed method at answer response, I had approached all the problems in a different light and in many circumstances had come to a better level of understanding than the 'ideal' student.  Well, I believe I did decently well on the midterm exam but ended up not finding the time to write the research paper, which was mandatory for the class.  I still wish to do the research.  Instead of successfully failing it, I received an e-mail from the professor saying that I had not submitted the paper and asking if I would opt to receive a 'No work submitted.' for the class.  This is a last ditch loophole the teacher can make for any student which essentially removes the class from the records, and doesn't affect your GPA in any manner.  So, obviously, I went with that option astounded at just how difficult it was to truly fail a class.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"> <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">So, having not fulfilled my plant science requirement, but still walked away with a tremendous amount of knowledge, the next quarter I took Biology 10V, which was recommended by my consoler and was what the majority of landscape architecture students took.  The V stands for virtual and was UC Davis's somewhat new attempt at online learning.  The class turned out to be a complete joke.  The webpages that were supposed to supposed to substitute for lectures look as if they were designed in 1990, complete with stupid gifs and everything.  After reading one lecture about how the tilt of the earth created the seasons, I couldn't continue.  The material was written at a elementary school level, and explained in such terms.  Reading simplified material that is way below your intellectual level is much harder and more painful than you may think.  I couldn't get through them.  It was a waste of my time.  This is the course that was supposed to substitute for plant science 2.  The course that was jammed packed with every interesting and fascinating concept involving plants, and instead replaced with an explanation of why seasons exist, and because it was the path of least resistance, it was the course almost all landscape architects took.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">END EDIT 1]<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"> <br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">The idea was that I was trying to spend all day learning, and not focusing on the grading system that I was beginning to understand was completely arbitrary.  To my great surprise, it was impossible to fail.  The two classes I attempted to fail I ended up getting a C in. I did none of the homework, none of the weekly tests, came into the final and winged it, and filled out a bunch of the work I was supposed to turn in weeks ago on the spot.  I know someone that got something like a 10% in a chemistry class and walked away with a C.  It is literally impossible to fail some classes.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">So what do the grades really mean if they don't reflect the amount you've learned in a class, your handle on the material presented, or really abide by any standards once so ever?  I suspect they exist to keep the students in continue fear of their failure, which has students cramming and stressing at the last minute and writing 10 page papers in an all-nighter jacked up on Adderall.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">This is not the ideal learning environment.  When information is crammed the night before and the students are studying in a stressed mindset, retention is low.  If the institution wanted to focus on the students learning, it wouldn't be set-up in this manner.  This is one of the main reasons I dropped out.  I could no longer support a system that I saw as wrong approach to teaching in so many aspects.  It made learning the enemy to be feared, not the fascinating, wonderful world of endless marvels that it is.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">Like any institution, it was set-up in a hierarchy, with each individual fearing the person in the position higher than them.  The students shouldn't fear their teachers, they should feel as if their teachers are there to guide and light their way.  On top of the system in general, I was upset with the overall quality of the education.  This might be unique to Landscape Architecture and other design-based majors, but I was literally learning nothing most days.  Our studio teacher would have a one hour lecture before studio, which usually wasn't too informative, and open-ended enough that they could fill it with completely arbitrary content, including sometimes simply playing a video.  Then studio would consist of a room of students not really sure what to do with the project they were given, while the teacher supervised and gave vague direction to a project that seemed to be completely throw together.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">I waited until junior year to drop out to ensure that upper division courses wouldn't be any different, to my great surprise they were actually easier, and it seems classes have been getting progressively easier since freshman year of high school, I kid you not.  This whole system that was designed to transform a high school graduate into an esteemed scholarly individual seemed to allow one to skate by with a modicum of information.  So I left the UC system. I don't know that all UC systems operate in this fashion, but I suspect so.  I understand that the state school system and the community college system have much different educational structures and philosophies and often better teachers, so I'm open to that, not to mention costing a fraction of the price.  Also, there are all sorts of new forms of online education and interactive technology based methods that are now only in their fetal development stages.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">These giant institutions weren't created in a world where the internet was a reality.  All the information one could get from the classroom and much, much more is available online, and it's hard to say if these institutions will remain relevant in a future of a new model of education.  Online and with the aid of computers lectures can be recorded once, and played any time, at the viewers convenience.  You don't need to pay the teacher every year to be in the classroom, you don't need to pay for the space to teach.  Students don't need to buy housing that is close to the campus.  Lectures can be watched when the student feels they're in an ideal learning mood.  Forcing your brain to function when you might be hungover or tired is pointless.  Lectures can be sped up, slowed down, paused, repeated.  If the prof. mentions a term the student doesn't know, they can pause the video and look it up.  These are just some simple advantages that digital educational has over traditional.  I'm sure as time goes on technology will continue to be leveraged in interesting ways to increase the effectiveness of digital learning.  Khan academy, MIT open courseware, Academic Earth, iTunes U, Wikipedia, Fora.tv, and many others have already begun to educate millions.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1">So for now, education is something I do on my own time, recreationally.  Am I completely done with any form of schooling? No.<br /></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_1"><br /></p>
                  <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style_1">Would I like to see new models and systems of education evolve and efficiently scale to educate the world? Yes.</p>
