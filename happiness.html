Another few books I'd recommend to help the human condition: Consolations of philosophy by Alain de Botton, the first 40 pages of The Power of Now (the rest of the book just kind of repeats itself), and communication books.  Remember, 70% of your success in the world is based on communication, only 30% is skill.  Being a good communicator can completely change your life. <br /></p>

                  <p class="paragraph_style_2">I'll end with this quote from Carl Sagan.  Once of the most liberating things you can realize, is really realize the true insignificance of your daily actions on the outcome of the universe.  I like astronomy, because I think it is very humbling, to realize how we are each simply atoms, getting stressed and upset about which direction to take.  None of it really matters in the end and that should free you to take risks without stressing over the potential hardships.<span class="style"><br /></span></p>

                  <p class="paragraph_style_37"><span class="style">&quot;Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every &quot;superstar,&quot; every &quot;supreme leader,&quot; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.<br /></span></p>

                  <p class="paragraph_style_37"><span class="style">The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.<br /></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_37"><span class="style"><br /></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_37"><span class="style">Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.<br /></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_37"><span class="style"><br /></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_37"><span class="style">The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.<br /></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_37"><span class="style"><br /></span></p>
                  <p class="paragraph_style_37"><span class="style">It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.&quot;</span><br /></p>
