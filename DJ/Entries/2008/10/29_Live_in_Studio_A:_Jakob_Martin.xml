    <richText>&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/jakobmartinmusic"&gt;Jakob Martin&lt;/a&gt;&#x2028;"Currently one of the fastest growing underground artists on the West&#x2028;Coast, Martin is best known for his raw musical style and lyrical&#x2028;mastery. Martin engages audiences with music, poetry, humor, and&#x2028;personal stories from his two years touring the United States, where he&#x2028;has performed over 500 concerts. In a time of dramatic change in the&#x2028;world, Jakob Martin&#x2019;s work is relevant, stimulating, edgy, witty, and&#x2028;emotionally stirring, and is unlike anything you will get anywhere&#x2028;else.&#xD;&#x2028;&lt;a href="http://169.237.101.92/archives/2008-10-16_628_192kbps.mp3"&gt;Show Direct Link&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;This guy was super chill, came in playin his mellow ass acoustic music, and even brought his own fan base of his brother, who played guest harmonica for the first time, and friends, who happened to be super cute hipster/hippie girls, one of which was wearing an obama shirt! +1 San Diego! Jakob was hella nice, and gave me his cd, which I played on my show, if you noticed. Oh yeah, and his hands were so soft when I shook them that I almost asked him if he moisturizes.&#xD;&lt;a href="http://www.zooomr.com/photos/recalcitrantid/sets/39549/"&gt;Photos&lt;/a&gt;&#x2028;&#x2028;&#xD;Happy Listening,&#x2028;DJ Recalcitrant id/ Ben</richText>
