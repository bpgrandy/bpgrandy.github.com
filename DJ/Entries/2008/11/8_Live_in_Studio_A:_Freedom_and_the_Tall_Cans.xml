    <richText>&lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/freedomandthetallcans"&gt;Freedom and the Tall Cans&lt;/a&gt; - are David Wilcox, Tim Mercer, Jarred Wright, and Freedom Glory: "local mountains kids that got bored".&#xA0;&#xD;&lt;a href="http://169.237.101.92/archives/2008-10-23_628_192kbps.mp3"&gt;Show Direct Link&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&#xD;Bluegrass that they say draws a large audience from kids and old people, despite the fact that they in no way intended that to be their demographic.&#xA0; The music kind of speaks for itself, and I can see how little kids would enjoy it.&#xA0; But these guys were super chill, I'm pretty sure a couple of them were high and apparently they asked if they could drink in the studio at some point, but overall I'd say it helped their music.&#xD;(Click on photos for larger)&#x2028;&#x2028;&#xD;...&lt;a href="http://www.zooomr.com/search/photos/%3Fq%3DFreedom%2520and%2520the%2520Tall%2520Cans"&gt;more photos&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;&lt;a href="http://www.zooomr.com/photos/recalcitrantid/sets/39549/"&gt;Live in Studio A Photos&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;Happy Listening&#x2028;DJ Recalcitrant id/ Ben</richText>
