    <richText>here's the link for the new show: &lt;a href="http://www.kdvs.org/shows/view/show_id/527/date/2008-09-05/"&gt;http://www.kdvs.org/shows/view/show_id/527/date/2008-09-05/&lt;/a&gt;&#xD;This week I actually had my shit together, so I managed to figure out what I was playing, set-up the playlist, and rip CDs all during my show.&#xA0; I was definitely multi-tasking and busy for the whole three hours, didn't get much time to just chill and listen to it, but at least I was being efficient.&#xA0; Try and figure out the relevance of the show picture.&#xA0; I'll give you a hint: it has to do with context.&#xA0; Unlimited scheduled dedicated mojo session for anyone who gets it.&#xD;New Adds:&#x2028;HEALTH - Health//Disco&#x2028;Dangerdoom - The Mouse &amp; The Mask&#x2028;Metal Fingers - Metal Fingers Presents:&#xA0; Special Herbs, Vol 9 &amp; 0&#x2028;N.W.A. - Gangsta Gansta&#x2028;Psychokinetics - Seven League Boots&#x2028;Deerhunter - Cryptograms&#x2028;BOAT - Let's Drag Our Feet&#x2028;Blonde Redhead - 23&#xD;So, this was my 2nd to last show, I'm thinking last show I'll try and put in some effort and do like a best of first quarter DJ, but don't be dissappointed if I end up not prepping at all...&#xA0; I asked some people if they keep up the old quarter links, and apparently the guy I was talking to still can access his from last year fall quarter, but I might try and achieve 'em somehow just to be safe.&#xA0; Hopefully I'll get a solid slot next quarter... I need to get mad volunteer hours before the 10th... I'm pretty much talking to myself at this point...&#xD;Happy listening,&#x2028;Ben</richText>
